# Example javascript implementation of a Mycroft GUI

This implementation serves html pages through the mycroft gui protocol. It is in a very stage and much still doesn't work and it's not very pretty to look at, but it can serve simple HTML pages triggered by skills.

Also note: I know basically nothing about javascript, this has been built by using the webconsole in Firefox and googling basically every line.

## Todos
- Variable access from the shown html page
- Multi-page skills (such as the weather)

## Example pages
In the folder `example_skill_pages` there will be example html pages that can be placed in the relevant skill's ui folder.
